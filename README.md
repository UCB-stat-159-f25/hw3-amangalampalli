This project focuses on analyzing LIGO data and demonstrating how these highly sensitive measurements can be applied to research in astrophysics and space science.

The repository is designed to make this work reproducible and clearly presented through a MyST-based website.

As I don’t have permission to edit the GitHub “About” section, I’m including the project link here instead.
